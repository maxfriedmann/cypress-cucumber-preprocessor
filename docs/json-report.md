# JSON reports

JSON reports can be enabled using the `json.enabled` property. The preprocessor uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), which means you can place configuration options in EG. `.cypress-cucumber-preprocessorrc.json` or `package.json`. An example configuration is shown below.

```json
{
  "json": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

The report is outputted to `cucumber-report.json` in the project directory, but can be configured through the `json.output` property.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are automatically added to JSON reports, including that of failed tests (unless you have disabled `screenshotOnRunFailure`).

## Attachments (browser environment)

Text, images and other data can be added to the output of the messages and JSON reports with attachments, using the browser API explained below.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach("foobar");
});
```

By default, text is saved with a MIME type of text/plain. You can also specify a different MIME type as part of a second argument.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach('{ "name": "foobar" }', { mediaType: "application/json" });
});
```

If you'd like, you can also specify a filename to be used if the attachment is made available to download as a file via a formatter.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach('{ "name": "foobar" }', {
    mediaType: "application/json",
    fileName: "results.json"
  });
});
```

Images and other binary data can be attached using a ArrayBuffer. The data will be base64 encoded in the output.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach(new TextEncoder().encode("foobar").buffer, { mediaType: "text/plain" });
});
```

If you've already got a base64-encoded string, you can prefix your mime type with `base64:` to indicate this.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach("Zm9vYmFy", { mediaType: "base64:text/plain" });
});
```

## Attachments (node environment)

Similar to the browser API explained above, attachments can also be added using a Node API. This is less typical and only required in specific scenarios. This API is available through the `onAfterStep` option in `addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin`, like shown below. The Node API mimicks the options found in the browser API.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach }) {
    attach("foobar");
  }
});
```

By default, text is saved with a MIME type of text/plain. You can also specify a different MIME type as part of a second argument.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach }) {
    attach('{ "name": "foobar" }', { mediaType: "application/json" });
  }
});
```

If you'd like, you can also specify a filename to be used if the attachment is made available to download as a file via a formatter.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach }) {
    attach('{ "name": "foobar" }', {
      mediaType: "application/json"
      fileName: "results.json"
    });
  }
});
```

Images and other binary data can be attached using a Buffer. The data will be base64 encoded in the output.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach }) {
    attach(Buffer.from("foobar"), { mediaType: "text/plain" });
  }
});
```

If you've already got a base64-encoded string, you can prefix your mime type with `base64:` to indicate this.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach }) {
    attach("Zm9vYmFy", { mediaType: "base64:text/plain" });
  }
});
```

The hook is furthermore invoked with a bunch of other, relevant data, similar to `AfterStep(..)`, with the addition of a `result` property.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ pickle, pickleStep, gherkinDocument, testCaseStartedId, testStepId, result }) {}
});
```

This information can, among other things, be used to determine if a step was the last step, like shown below.

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ attach, pickle, pickleStep }) {
    const wasLastStep =
      pickle.steps[pickle.steps.length - 1] === pickleStep;

    if (wasLastStep) {
      attach("foobar");
    }
  }
});
```

## Logging

You can log useful information from your support code with the simple `log` function. This is available in both the browser and node environment.

```ts
import { Given, log } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  log("Something interesting happened!");
});
```

```ts
await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
  onAfterStep({ log }) {
    log("Something interesting happened!");
  }
});
```

Anything you log will be attached as a string with a MIME type of `text/x.cucumber.log+plain`.
